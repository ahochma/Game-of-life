# Game-of-life
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton. Conway's game of life is described here: A cell C is represented by a 1 when alive, or 0 when dead, in an m-by-m (or m√óm) square array of cells.
